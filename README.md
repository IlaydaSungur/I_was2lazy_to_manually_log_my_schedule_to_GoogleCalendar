# I_was2lazy_to_manually_log_my_schedule_to_GoogleCalendar
Mt were coming up and i needed to structure everything outside of my brain, so in mid semester i decided to log all the classes and exams..... Never do anything in 4am, your brain gets too distractive lol. Anyways I decided to write a program instead of clicking the buttons on the web, I HATE REPETTETIVE MOVEMENTS...... so yeah
